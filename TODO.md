TODO:

* Add notes, re: pre-requisites (eg. deployment directory structure)
** Assumptions, eg. /var/lib/sitedata/<sitename>, /var/www/<appname>/releases
* Fix up .md files
* After loading, print config?
* Mention git attributes for git archive
* For drupal: ensure files directory and settings.php are excluded by git archive

Recipe future possibilities:

* Turn into xml / validate against xsd, show what variables / overrides are available, etc
* Store in database - manage via admin app, eg. elearning
