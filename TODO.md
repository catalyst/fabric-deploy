TODO:
* Add notes, re: pre-requisites (eg. deployment directory structure)
* Fix up .md files
* After loading, print config?

Recipe future possibilities:
* Turn into xml / validate against xsd, show what variables / overrides are available, etc
* Store in database - manage via admin app, eg. elearning
